# _happytimes_

ðŸ˜ŠCommand line tool that helps you classifying and organizing automagically your photos, videos, audios and documents âœ¨

- Having thousands of pictures and videos lost in infinitely nested folder structures?
- Don't you remember what camera or phone did you use to take that picture, or if it's even yours?
- Are you not sure if you have duplicates of the same picture?
- Do you have many screen shots mixed up with your regular photos?
